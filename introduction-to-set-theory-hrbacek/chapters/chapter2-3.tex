\dfn[equivalence]{Equivalence}{

        \ii \(R\) is called an \textit{equivalence on} \(A\) if it is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive in \(A\).

\dfn[equivalenceClass]{Equivalence Class}{
    Let \(E\) be an equivalence on \(A\) and let \(a \in A\).

    \ii
    (\(\Rightarrow\))
    Suppose \(aEb\).
    Take any \(c \in [a]_E\). Then, \(cEa\) and \(aEb\), and thus \(cEb\)
    by transitivity. Hence, \(c \in [b]_E\); \([a]_E \subseteq [b]_E\).
    \([b]_E \subseteq [a]_E\) can be shown similarly since \(bEa\) holds as \(E\) is symmetric.

    (\(\Leftarrow\))
    Suppose \([a]_E = [b]_E\). Since \(aEa\) by reflexivity,
    we have \(a \in [a]_E = [b]_E\). Therefore, \(aEb\).

    \ii
    (\(\Rightarrow\))
    Suppose \([a]_E \cap [b]_E \neq \OO\).
    Then, there exists \(c \in [a]_E \cap [b]_E\), i.e., \(cEa\) and \(cEb\).
    Then, as \(E\) is symmetric, we have \(aEc\),

    Suppose \(aEb\). Then, since \(aEa\) by reflexivity,
    we have \(a \in [a]_E\). We can see \(a \in [b]_E\) from (i).

    If \([a]_E \neq [b]_E\), then by \Cref{lem:equivIffSameClass},
    we have \([a]_E \cap [b]_E = \OO\).
    Since \(E\) is reflexive, \(a \in [a]_E\); each \([a]_E\) is nonempty.
    Therefore, \(A/E\) is a system of mutually disjoint nonempty sets.

    Take any \(a \in A\).
    Since \(E\) is reflexive, \(a \in [a]_E \subseteq \bigcup A/E\).
    Therefore, \(A \subseteq \bigcup A/E\).

    \ii
    Assume \(aE_Sb\). Then, there exists \(C \in S\) such that \(a, b \in C\).

    \ii
    Take any \([a]_{E_S} \in A/E_S\).
    Since \(S\) is a partition, there (uniquely) exists \(C\) such that \(a \in C\).

        \iff a E_S b
        \underbrace{\iff}_{\text{\Cref{lem:equivIffSameClass}}} b \in [a]_{E_S}\);
    \(C = [a]_{E_S}\). Therefore, \(A/E_S \subseteq S\).

    For the converse, take any \(C \in S\).
    As \(C\) is nonempty, we may take some \(a \in C\).
    Similarly, we have \(C = [a]_{E_S}\). Therefore, \(C \subseteq A/E_S\).

    If \(a \neq b\) and \(b \neq c\), then \(aSb\) and \(bSc\),
    and thus \(aSc\) as \(S\) is transitive in \(A\);
    \(R\) is transitive in \(A)\).

    \(R\) is reflexive in \(A\) since \(\mrm{Id}_A \subseteq R\).

    Take any \(p_1, p_2 \in P\) and assume \(h(p_1) \preceq h(p_2)\).
