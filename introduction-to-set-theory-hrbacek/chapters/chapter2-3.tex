    \([b]_E \subseteq [a]_E\) can be shown similarly since \(bEa\) holds as \(E\) is symmetric.

    Take any \(p_1, p_2 \in P\) and assume \(h(p_1) \preceq h(p_2)\).

    Note that \(\mathord{\prec} = \mathord{<}_1 \cup \mathord{<}_2 \cup A_1 \times A_2\).

    Suppose \(x \prec y\) and \(y \prec x\).
    By definition, \(x, y \in A_1\) or \(x, y \in A_2\).
    In both cases, we have (\(x <_1 y\) and \(y <_1 x\))

    Hence, \(\prec\) is asymmetric.
    Transitivity of \(\prec\) can be shown easily.

    Since \(\mathord{<_1} \cap A_2^2 = \mathord{<_2} \cap A_1^2 = (A_1 \times A_2) \cap A_1^2 = (A_1 \times A_2) \cap A_2^2 = \OO\),
