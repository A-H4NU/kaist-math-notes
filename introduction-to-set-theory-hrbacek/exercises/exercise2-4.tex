    Let \(f\) be a function on \(A\) onto \(B\).
    Define a relation \(E\) in \(A\) by: \(aEb\) if and only if \(f(a) = f(b)\).
    \begin{enumerate}[nolistsep, label=(\roman*)]
        \ii
        Show that \(E\) is an equivalence on \(A\).
        \ii
        Show that \([a]_E = [a']_E\) implies that \(f(a) = f(a')\)
        so that the function \(\varphi\) on \(A/E\) into \(B\)
        defined by \(\varphi([a]_E) = f(a)\) is well-defined.
        Show also that \(\varphi\) is \textit{onto} \(B\).
        \ii
        Let \(j\) be the function on \(A\) onto \(A/E\) given by \(j(a) = [a]_E\).
        Show that \(\varphi \circ j = f\).
    \end{enumerate}
}
\mclm{Proof}{\hfill
\begin{enumerate}[nolistsep, label=(\roman*)]
    \ii
    \(E\) can readily be shown to be reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.

    \ii
    Assume \([a]_E = [a']_E\). Then, \(f(a) = f(a')\) by definition of \(E\). Hence, \(\varphi\) is well-defined.
    Take any \(b \in B\). Since \(f\) is onto, there exists \(a \in A\) such that \(f(a) = b\).
    Hence, \(\varphi([a]_E) = f(a) = b\); \(\varphi\) is onto \(B\).

    \ii
    \(\dom (\varphi \circ j) = (\dom j) \cap j\inv[\dom \varphi] = A = \dom f\)
    since \(j\) is onto.
    For all \(a \in A\), \((\varphi \circ j)(a) = \varphi([a]_E) = f(a)\).
    Hence, by \Cref{lem:functionEqualsIff}, \(\varphi \circ j = f\).
    \qed
