\section{Analyticity}

\begin{Definition}{Analytic Function}[]
\begin{itemize}
    \ii
    For a fixed point \(z_0 \in \CC\),
    a function \(f\) is \emph{analytic} at \(z_0\)
    if there is some \(r > 0\) such that
    \(f\) is differentiable at every point in
    \(B_r(z_0) \triangleq \{\,z \in \CC \colon |z - z_0| < r\,\}\).

    \ii
    A function \(f\) is \emph{analytic in domain \(D\)}
    if it is analytic at \(z\) for all \(z \in D\).

    \ii
    A function \(f\) is \emph{entire} if it is analytic in \(\CC\).
\end{itemize}
\end{Definition}

\begin{Theorem}{}[uvAnalytic]
    Given a function \(f(z) = u(x,y)+iv(x,y)\) in domain \(D\), if
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*)]
        \ii \(u(x, y)\) and \(v(x, y)\) are \(C^1\) in \(D\), and if
        \ii \(u(x,y)\) and \(v(x,y)\) satisfy the Cauchy--Riemann equations in \(D\),
    \end{enumerate}
    then \(f\) is analytic in \(D\).
\end{Theorem}
\begin{myproof}[Proof]
    Fix \(z = x + iy \in D\) and write \(\Delta z \coloneqq \xi + i\eta\) for \(\xi,\eta \in \RR\)
    where \(\Delta z\) is sufficiently small. (This is possible since \(D\) is open.)
    Then,
    \begin{align*}
        f(z+\Delta z)
        &= (f(z+\xi)-f(z)) - (f(z+\Delta z)-f(z+\xi)) \\
        &= \int_0^1 \frac{\d}{\d t} f(x+t\xi, y) \d t + \int_0^1 \frac{\d}{\d t} f(x+\xi+i(y+t\eta)) \bigr) \d t \\
        &= \xi\int_0^1 f_x(x+t\xi) \d t + \eta\int_0^1 f_y(x+\xi+i(y+t\eta)) \d t \\
        &= \xi\int_0^1 f_x(x+t\xi) \d t + i\eta\int_0^1 f_x(x+\xi+i(y+t\eta)) \d t \\
        &= f_x(z) \Delta z + \xi\int_0^1 \bigl(f_x(x+t\xi) - f_x(z)\bigr) \d t + i\eta\int_0^1 \bigl(f_x(x+\xi+i(y+t\eta))-f(z)\bigr) \d t
    \end{align*}
    As \(f_x\) is continuous at \(z\), we have
    \begin{gather*}
        \left| \int_0^1 \bigl(f_x(x+t\xi) - f_x(z)\bigr) \d t \right| \to 0\text{ and} \\
        \left| \int_0^1 \bigl(f_x(x+\xi+i(y+t\eta))-f(z)\bigr) \d t \right| \to 0
    \end{gather*}
    as \(\Delta z \to 0\). Moreover, since \((\Re z) / z\) and \((\Im z)/z\) are bounded,
    we have
    \begin{equation*}
        \lim_{\Delta z \to 0} \frac{f(z+\Delta z) - f(z)}{\Delta z} = f_x(z)\text.
        \tag*{\qedhere}
    \end{equation*}
\end{myproof}

\begin{Example}{}[]
    % FIXME: Something is wrong.
    (Something's wrong here.)
    Let \(f(x+iy) = x^2 + y^2 + ixy\).
    \(u_x = 2x\), \(u_y = 2y\), \(v_x = y\), and \(v_y = x\).
    Hence, \(u\) and \(v\) are \(C^1\) in \(\RR^2\).
    \(f_x = 2x + yi\) and \(-i f_y = -i (2y + xi) = x - 2yi\);
    hence \(f\) satisfies the Cauchy--Riemann equation only at \(z = 0\).
    Hence, by \Cref{th:uvAnalytic}, \(f\) is nowhere analytic.
\end{Example}

\begin{Example}{Analyticity of Principal Log}[]
    Let \(f(z) = \Log z\) and let \(D = \CC \setminus \RR_{\le 0}\)
    be a domain.
    Write \(\Log z = \ln\sqrt{x^2+y^2} + i\Arg z\)
    so \(u = \ln\sqrt{x^2+y^2}\) and \(v = \Arg(x+iy)\). \(u\) is obviously \(C^1\) on \(D\).
    As for \(v\), as \(z\) is fixed, one may choose \(\Arg z\) from
    \[
        \Arg z = \pm\arccos\left(\frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}\right),
        \arctan\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)
    \]
    depending on \(z\) to argue that \(\Arg z\) is \(C^1\) on
    a local neighborhood of \(z\).
    Hence, \(u\) is \(C^1\) on \(D\).

    Write \(f(z) = \ln r + i\theta\) in polar coordinates.
    \(f_r = -if_\theta/r\) is the Cauchy--Riemann equation in the polar form.
    \(f_x = f_r \cos\theta - f_\theta \frac{\sin\theta}{r}\);
    \(-if_y = -i\left(f_r \sin\theta + \frac{\cos\theta}{r}\right)\).
    \(f'(z) = f_x = \frac{1}{r}(\cos\theta - i \sin\theta) = \frac{1}{re^{i\theta}} = \frac{1}{z}\).

    Similarly, with some fixed branch cut, \(\log z\) is also analytic on \(\CC\)
    except for the ray of branch cut.
