\section{The Countability Axioms}

\dfn{First Countability Axiom}{
    A topological space $X$ is said to have a \textit{countable basis at} $x$
    if there is a countable collection $\mcal B$ of neighborhoods of $x$ in $X$
    such that, for each neighborhood $U$ of $x$, there exists $B \in \mcal B$
    with $B \subseteq U$. A space that has a countable basis at each point is
    said to satisfy the \textit{first countability axiom}, or to be
    \textit{first-countable}.
}

\nt{
    This definition was already given in \Cref{def:1stCt}.
    Recall the lemmas \Cref{lem:seqLemma} and \Cref{lem:seqConvIffImgConv}.
}

\dfn{Second Countability Axiom}{
    If a topological space $X$ has a countable basis for its topology, then
    $X$ is said to satisfy the \textit{second countability axiom}, or to be
    \textit{second-countable}.
}

\exmp{}{
    $\RR[J]$ endowed with the product topology with a countable set $J$ is
    second-countable;
    \[
        \mcal S \triangleq \bigcup_{\alpha \in J} \big\{\, \pi_{\alpha}\inv
        \big((a, b)\big) \:\big|\: a, b \in \QQ \text{ and } a<b \big\}
    \]
    is a countable subbasis for $\RR[J]$, which induces a countable basis for
    $\RR[J]$.
}

\nt{
    If a topological space $X$ is second-countable with a countable basis
    $\mcal B= \{B_n\}_{n \in \ZZ_+}$ and a subspace $A \subseteq X$ with the
    discrete topology. Then, $A$ must be countable.

    Otherwise, for each $a \in A$, there exists $B_a \in \mcal B$ such that
    $B_a \cap A = \{a\}$. This induces an injection $A \hookrightarrow \mcal B$.
    Hence, $A$ is countable.
}

\exmp[RUnifNot2ndCt]{Uniform Topology and Countability Axioms}{
    In the uniform topology, $\RR[\omega]$ is first-countable by
    \Cref{exmp:metIs1stCt}. Let $\mcal B$ be a basis of $\RR[\omega]$. Let
    \[
        A \triangleq \big\{\,(x_i)_{i \in \ZZ_+} \in \RR[\omega] \:\big|\:
        \forall i \in \ZZ_+,\: x_i \in \{\,0, 1\,\}\,\big\}\text{.}
    \]
    Then, $A$ has the discrete topology but $A$ is uncountable. Therefore,
    $\RR[\omega]$ with the uniform topology is not second-countable.

\exmp[REllCt]{$\RR_\ell$ and Countability Axioms}{

        \ii Given $x \in \RR_\ell$, $\{\,[x, x + 1/n) \mid n \in \ZZ_+\,\}$
            is a countable basis at $x$. $\RR_\ell$ is first-countable.
        \ii $\cl{\QQ} = \RR_\ell$. $\RR_\ell$ is separable.
        \ii Let $\mcal B$ be a basis for $\RR_\ell$. Choose, for each $x \in
            \RR_\ell$, an element $B_x \in \mcal B$ such that $x \in B_x
            \subseteq [x, x+1)$. If $x \neq y$, then $B_x \neq B_y$. Hence
            $x \mapsto B_x$ is an injection; $\mcal B$ is uncountable.
            Therefore, $\RR_\ell$ is not second-countable.
    \end{itemize}
    We now prove $\RR_\ell$ is Lindelöf. Thanks to \Cref{lem:topByBIsUnionsOfB},
    we only have to prove that, for any open covering $\mcal A$ of $\RR_\ell$
    by the basis elements, there is a countable subcovering.

    Let $\mcal A = \{\,[a_\alpha, b_\alpha) \mid \alpha \in J\,\}$ be an open
    covering of $\RR_\ell$. Let $C \triangleq \bigcup_{\alpha \in J} (a_\alpha,
    b_\alpha)$. We now claim that $\RR \setminus C$ is countable.
    Let $x \in \RR \setminus C$. Then $x = a_\beta$ for some $\beta \in J$.
    Choose $q_x \in \QQ$ such that $q_x \in (a_\beta, b_\beta)$.
    If $x, y \in \RR \setminus C$ and $x < y$, then $q_x < q_y$. Hence
    $x \mapsto q_x$ defines an injection $\RR \setminus C \hookrightarrow \QQ$.
    Therefore, $\RR \setminus C$ is countable.

    Now, let $\mcal A'$ be a countable subcollection of $\mcal A$ that covers
    $\RR \setminus C$. Now, note that $\{\,(a_\alpha, b_\alpha) \mid \alpha \in
    J\,\}$ is an open covering of $C$ as a subspace of $\RR$ (with the standard
    topology). Since $\RR$ is second-countable, there exists a finite
    subcollection $\{\,(a_{\alpha_1}, b_{\alpha_1}), \cdots, (a_{\alpha_n},
    b_{\alpha_n})\,\}$ covers $C$. Let $\mcal A'' \triangleq \{\,[a_{\alpha_1},
    b_{\alpha_1}), \cdots, [a_{\alpha_n}, b_{\alpha_n})\}$.
    Then, $\mcal A' \cup \mcal A''$ is a countble subcovering of $\RR_\ell$.
}

\exmp[sorgenfrey]{The Product of Two Lindelöf Spaces Need Not Be Lindelöf}{
    Although $\RR_\ell$ is Lindelöf, $\RR_\ell \times \RR_\ell$ is not.
    Consider the subspace $L \triangleq \{\,x \times (-x) \mid x \in
    \RR_\ell\}$. Then, $L$ has the discrete topology as $\big([x, x+1) \times
    [-x, -x+1)\big) \cap L = \{x \times (-x)\}$. Hence, $L$ is not Lindelöf;
    $\RR_\ell^2$ is not Lindelöf.
}

\exmp{A Subspace of a Lindelöf Space Need Not Be Lindelöf}{
    The ordered square $I_o^2$ is compact (\Cref{exmp:orderedSqIsCpt}) and thus
    is Lindelöf. However, the subspace $A = I \times (0, 1)$ is not Lindelöf
    as an open covering $\{\,\{x\} \times (0, 1) \mid x \in I\,\}$ does not
    allow a countable subcovering.

                \end{cases}

            we find that $U$ and $V$ are disjoint neighborhoods of $\vec x$ and
            $\vec y$ in $X$.

            $\vec x \in B \subseteq U$. For each $\alpha \in J$, let $V_\alpha

            in $X$ such that $\cl{V_\alpha} \subseteq U_\alpha$. Then, $V =
            \prod_{\alpha \in J} V_\alpha$ is a neighborhood of $\vec x$ and
            $\cl V = \prod_{\alpha \in J} \cl{V_\alpha} \subseteq B \subseteq
            U$. By \Cref{lem:T34Iff}, $X$ is $T_3$.

\exmp[RlsrIsNotT4]{$\RR_\ell^2$ is not $T_4$}{
    The space $\RR_\ell$ is $T_3$; hence $\RR_\ell^2$ is $T_3$ by
    \Cref{th:prodSep}.

    Suppose $\RR_\ell^2$ is normal for the sake of contradiction. Let $L$ be
    a subspace of $\RR_\ell^2$ where $L \triangleq \{\,x \times (-x) \in \RR^2
    \mid x \in \RR\,\}$. Here are some facts:
    \begin{itemize}[nolistsep]
        \ii $L$ has the discrete topology. Thus, every subset of $L$ is closed
            in $L$, especially.
        \ii $L$ is closed in $\RR_\ell^2$ as it is closed in $\RR^2$, which is
            coarser than $\RR_\ell^2$.
        \ii Every subset $A$ of $L$ is closed in $\RR_\ell^2$.
        \ii For every $\varnothing \neq A \subsetneq L$, there are disjoint
            open sets $U_A$ and $V_A$ in $\RR_\ell^2$ containing $A$ and $L
            \setminus A$, respectively.
    \end{itemize}
    Here, we define a function $\theta \colon \mcal P(L) \to \mcal P(\QQ^2)$ by
    \[
        A \mapsto \begin{cases}
            \QQ^2 \cap U_A & \text{if } \varnothing \subsetneq A \subsetneq L \\
            \varnothing    & \text{if } A = \varnothing \\
            \QQ^2          & \text{if } A = L\text{.}
        \end{cases}
    \]

    To show $\theta$ is injective, let $\varnothing \subsetneq A, B \subsetneq
    L$ with $A \neq B$. \textsf{WLOG}, $A \not\subseteq B$; let $x \in A
    \setminus B$. Then, since $x \in L \setminus B$, $x \in U_A \cap V_B$.
    Since $\QQ^2$ is dense in $\RR_\ell^2$ and $U_A \cap V_B$ is open and
    nonempty, there exists $q \in \QQ^2 \cap U_A \cap V_B$. Hence,
    $\QQ^2 \cap U_A \not\subseteq \QQ^2 \cap U_B$. Therefore, $\theta$
    is injective.

    Also, the map $\psi \colon \mcal P(\ZZ_+) \to \RR$ defined by
    \[
        S \mapsto \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \frac{a_i}{10^i}
    \] is injective where $a_i = 1$ if $i \in S$ and $a_i = 0$ if $i \notin S$.
    Thus, there exists an injective map $\psi' \colon \mcal
    P(\QQ^2) \to L$. Then, $\psi' \circ \theta$ is an injective map from
    $\mcal P(L)$ to $L$, \#. (\Cref{th:noInjSurjWithPSet})

\section{Normal Spaces}

\thm[2ndCtT3IsT4]{}{
    Every second-countable $T_3$ space is $T_4$.
}
\pf{Proof}{
    Let $X$ be a regular space with a countable basis $\mcal B$. Let $A$ and
    $B$ be disjoint closed subsets of $X$. For each $x \in
    A$, there exists a neighborhood $U$ of $x$ that does not intersect $B$.
    By \Cref{lem:T34Iff}, there exists a neighborhood $V$ of $x$ such that
    $\cl V \subseteq U$. Finally, choose an element of $\mcal B$ such that
    $x \in B \subseteq V$. Collecting such basis elements, we obtain a
    countable covering of $A$ by open sets whose closures do not intersect $B$.
    Let us denote it by $\{U_n\}_{n \in \ZZ_+}$. Similarly, choose a countable
    collection $\{V_n\}_{n \in \ZZ_+}$ of open sets covering $B$ whose closures
    do not intersect $A$.

    For each $n \in \ZZ_+$ define
    \[
        U_n' \triangleq U_n \setminus \left(\bigcup_{i=1}^n \cl{V_i}\right)
        \quad\text{and}\quad
        V_n' \triangleq V_n \setminus \left(\bigcup_{i=1}^n \cl{U_i}\right)\text{.}
    \]
    Each $U_n'$ and $V_n'$ is open. Moreover, $\{U_n'\}_{n \in \ZZ_+}$ and
    $\{V_n'\}_{n \in \ZZ_+}$ cover $A$ and $B$, respectively, since
    $\cl{V_i}$ and $\cl{U_i}$ does not intersect $A$ and $B$, respectively.

    Let
    \[
        U' \triangleq \bigcup_{n \in \ZZ_+} U_n' \quad\text{and}\quad
        V' \triangleq \bigcup_{n \in \ZZ_+} V_n'\text{.}
    \]
    If there exists $x \in U' \cap V'$, then $x \in U_j' \cap V_k'$ for some
    $j$ and $k$. \textsf{WLOG}, $j \le k$. $x \in U_j' \subseteq U_j$
    but $x \in X \setminus \cl{U_k} \subseteq X \setminus \cl{U_j} \subseteq X
    \setminus  U_j$, \#. Hence, $U'$ and $V'$ are disjoint open sets that
    contain $A$ and $B$, respectively.
}

\thm[metIsT4]{}{
    Every metrizable space is $T_4$.
}
\pf{Proof}{
    Let $X$ be a metrizable space with metric $d$.
    Let $A$ and $B$ be disjoint closed subsets of $X$. For each $a \in A$,
    choose $\veps_a$ so that $B(a, \veps_a) \cap B = \varnothing$. Similarly,
    for each $b \in B$ choose $\veps_b$ so chat $B(b, \veps_b) \cap A = \varnothing$.
    Let
    \[
        U \triangleq \bigcup_{a \in A} B(a, \veps_a/2) \quad\text{and}\quad
        V \triangleq \bigcup_{b \in B} B(b, \veps_b/2)\text{.}
    \]
    Then, they are open sets that contain $A$ and $B$, respectively.
    To show they are disjoint, suppose there is $x \in U \cap V$ for the sake
    of contradiction. Then, there are $a \in A$ and $b \in B$ such that
    $x \in B(a, \veps_a/2) \cap B(b, \veps_b/2)$. \textsf{WLOG}, $\veps_a \le \veps_b$.
    From the triangle inequality, we get $d(a, b) < (\veps_a + \veps_b) / 2
    \le \veps_b$; $a \in B(b, \veps_b) \cap A$, which contradicts out construction.
}

\thm[cptHausIsT4]{}{
    Every compact Hausdorff space is $T_4$.
}
\pf{Proof}{
    Let $X$ be a compact Hausdorff space. Let $A$ and $B$ be disjoint closed
    sets in $X$. $A$ and $B$ are compact by \Cref{th:cldInCptIsCpt}. Therefore,
    by \Cref{cor:cptAndPntOutside}, for each $a \in A$, there are disjoint open
    sets $U_a$ and $V_a$ in $X$ such that $a \in U_a$ and $B \subseteq V_a$.
    Since $\{U_a\}_{a \in A}$ covers $A$, $A$ may be covered by finitely many
    sets $U_{a_1}, U_{a_2}, \cdots, U_{a_n}$. Then, let
    \[
        U \triangleq U_{a_1} \cup U_{a_2} \cup \cdots \cup U_{a_n} \quad\text{and}\quad
        V \triangleq V_{a_1} \cap V_{a_2} \cap \cdots \cap V_{a_n}\text{.}
    \]
    They are disjoint open sets containing $A$ and $B$, respectively.
}

\thm[wellOrdIsT4]{}{
    Every well-ordered set $X$ is $T_4$ in the order topology.
}
\pf{Proof}{
    Consider an interval of the form $(x, y]$. If $y$ is the largest element,
    then $(x, y]$ is a basis element. If $y$ is not the largest element, then
    $(x, y] = (x, y')$ where $y'$ is the immediate successor of $y$. Hence,
    $(x, y]$ is always open. \checkmark

    Now let $A$ and $B$ be disjoint closed sets in $X$. First consider the case
    that neither contains the least element. For each $a \in A$, there exists
    a basis element about $a$ disjoint from $B$; it contains some interval
    of the form $(x_a, a]$. Similarly, choose $(y_b, b]$ disjoint from $A$.
    The sets
    \[
        U \triangleq \bigcup_{a \in A} (x_a, a] \quad\text{and}\quad
        V \triangleq \bigcup_{b \in B} (y_b, b]
    \]
    are open sets containing $A$ and $B$, respectively. Suppose $z \in U \cap V$
    for the sake of contradiction. Then $z \in (x_a, a] \cap (y_b, b]$ for some
    $a \in A$ and $b \in B$. \textsf{WLOG}, $a < b$. Then, $a \in (y_b, b]$
    while $(y_b, b] \cap A = \varnothing$, \#. Hence $U \cap V = \varnothing$.

    Now consider the case, \textsf{WLOG}, $a_0$, the least element, is
    contained in $A$. Then, since $\{a_0\}$ is both open and closed in $X$,
    we may find $U$ and $V$ for $A \setminus \{a_0\}$ and $B$ like above
    and conclude $U \cup \{a_0\}$ and $V$ are disjoint open sets that
    contain $A$ and $B$, respectively.

    Actually, \textit{every} order topology is normal.
