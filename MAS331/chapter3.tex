\dfn{Separation and Connectedness}{
    Let $X$ be a topological space.
    A \textit{separation} of $X$ is a pair $U$ and $V$
    of subsets of $X$ which satisfy the following.
    \begin{enumerate}[nolistsep, label=(\roman*)]
        \ii $U$ and $V$ are open in $X$.
        \ii $U \cap V = \varnothing$.
        \ii $U \cup V = X$.
    \end{enumerate}
    The space $X$ is said to be \textit{connected}
    if there does not exist a separation of $X$.
}
\nt{
    Connectedness ia a topological property.
}
\nt{
    A space $X$ is connected if and only if the only subsets of $X$
    that are both open and closed in $X$ are the empty sets and $X$ itself.
}

\mlemma[sepIffNotContainLimPts]{}{
    If $Y$ is a subspace of $X$,
    $A, B \subseteq Y$ is a separation of $Y$
    if and only if $A \cap B = \varnothing$, $A \cup B = Y$,
    and neither $A$ nor $B$ contains a limit point of the other.
}
\pf{Proof}{
    Suppose $A$ and $B$ form a separation of $Y$.
    Then, $A$ is both open and closed in $Y$; thus
    the closure of $A$ in $Y$ is $\cl A \cap Y = A$
    by \Cref{th:closureSubspace}.
    In other words, $\cl A \cap B = \varnothing$.
    Similarly, $A \cap \cl B = \varnothing$. \checkmark

    Suppose $A$ and $B$ are disjoint subsets of $Y$ whose union is $Y$
    and $A \cap B' = A' \cap B = \varnothing$.
    Thus, $A \cap \cl B = \cl A \cap B = \varnothing$.
    This implies $\cl A \cap Y = A$ and $\cl B \cap Y = B$; $A$ and $B$ are closed in $Y$,
    and thus they are open in $Y$ as well.
}

\mlemma[connInDisconn]{}{
    If the sets $C$ and $D$ form a separation of a space $X$,
    and if $Y$ is a connected subspace of $X$,
    then $Y$ lies entirely within $C$ or $D$.
}
\pf{Proof}{
    $C \cap Y$ and $D \cap Y$ are open in $Y$.
    Also, $(C \cap Y) \cup (D \cap Y) = (C \cup D) \cap Y = Y$.
    If they were both unempty, they would form a separation of $Y$.
    Thus, one of them is empty; $Y$ is entirely in the other.
}

\thm[UconnIfHaveCommonPt]{}{
    Let $X$ be a topological space.
    Let $\{A_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in J}$ be a family of connected subspaces of $X$.
    If $\bigcap_{\alpha \in J} A_\alpha \neq \varnothing$,
    then $\bigcup_{\alpha \in J} A_\alpha$ is connected.
}
\pf{Proof}{
    Take any $p \in \bigcap_{\alpha \in J} A_\alpha$.
    Suppose $C$ and $D$ form a separation of $Y = \bigcup_{\alpha \in J} A_\alpha$.
    \textsf{WLOG}, $p \in C$.
    For each $\alpha \in J$, since $p \in C \cap A_\alpha$,
    by \Cref{lem:connInDisconn}, $A_\alpha \subseteq C$.
    Thus, $\bigcup_{\alpha \in J} A_\alpha \subseteq C$,
    contradicting that $D \cap Y \neq \varnothing$.
}

\thm[connIfBtwAandClA]{}{
    Let $A$ be a connected subspace of $X$.
    If $A \subseteq B \subseteq \cl A$,
    then $B$ is also connected.
}
\pf{Proof}{
    Suppose $B = C \cup D$ is a separation of $B$
    for the sake of contradiction.
    By \Cref{lem:connInDisconn}, \textsf{WLOG}, $A \subseteq C$.
    Then, $B \subseteq \cl A \subseteq \cl C$.
    Since $\cl C \cap D = \varnothing$ by \Cref{lem:sepIffNotContainLimPts},
    $B \cap D = \varnothing$, which makes $C$ and $D$ not form a separation, \#.
}

\thm[contiSendsContiToConti]{Connected Space and Continuous Map}{
    Let $f \colon X \to Y$ be a continuous map.
    If $X$ is connected, then $\Img f$ is connected.
}
\pf{Proof}{
    Note that the surjective map $g \colon X \to \Img f$ obtained by
    restricting the codomain of $f$ is also continuous by \Cref{th:constructConti}.
    Suppose $\Img f = A \cup B$ is a separation of $\Img f$.
    Then, $g\inv(A)$ and $g\inv(B)$ are open and disjoint sets in $X$
    whose union is $X$, which is a contradiction to the connectedness of $X$.
}

\thm[finProdConnIsConn]{Connected Space and Finite Product}{
    Let $\{X_i\}_{i=1}^n$ be a finite family of connected spaces.
    then,
    \[
        X = \prod_{i=1}^n X_i
    \] is connected.
}
\pf{Proof}{
    It is enough to prove for two connected spaces $X$ and $Y$;
    extension to finite products can be done inductively.
    We may assume $X$ and $Y$ are nonempty.
    Take any $a \times b \in X \times Y$.
    Let $x \in X$.
    $X \times \{b\}$ and $\{x\} \times Y$ as subspaces of $X \times Y$
    are connected since they are homeomorphic with $X$ and $Y$, respectively.
    Thus,
    \[
        T_x = (X \times \{b\}) \cup (\{x\} \times Y)
    \] is connected by \Cref{th:UconnIfHaveCommonPt}, having
    $x \times b$ as a common point of two spaces.
    Thus, \[
        X \times Y = \bigcup_{x \in X} T_x
    \] is connected as they have a point $a \times b$ in common.
}

\thm[arbProdConnIsConn]{Connected Space and Product Topology}{
    Let $\{X_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in J}$ be a family of connected spaces.
    Then,
    \[
        X = \prod_{\alpha \in J} X_{\alpha}
    \] is connected in the product topology.
}
\pf{Proof}{
    We may assume that $X_\alpha \neq \varnothing$ for each $\alpha \in J$.
    Let $\vec a = (a_\alpha)_{\alpha \in J}$ be a fixed point of $X$.

    We first note that, given any finite subset $K$ of $J$,
    $X_K \triangleq \{\,(x_\alpha)_{\alpha \in J} \mid
    \forall \alpha \in J \setminus K,\: x_\alpha = a_\alpha\,\}$
    is a connected subspace of $X$ as $X_K$ is homeomorphic with $\prod_{\alpha \in K} X_\alpha$,
    which is connected by \Cref{th:finProdConnIsConn}.
    Note that $Y \triangleq \bigcup \{\,X_K \mid K \subseteq J \text{ and } K \text{ is finite}\,\}$
    as a subspace of $X$ is connected since $\vec a \in X_K$ for every finite $K \subseteq J$.

    Let $\vec x \in X$ and $B = \bigcap_{i=1}^n \pi_{\alpha_i}\inv(U_{\alpha_i})$ be
    any basis that contains $\vec x$ where $\alpha_i \in J$ for each $i \in [n]$.
    Define $\vec x' \in X$ be
    \[
        (\vec x')_{\alpha} \triangleq \begin{cases}
            x_\alpha & \text{if } \alpha = \alpha_i \text{ for some } i \in [n] \\
            a_\alpha & \text{otherwise.}
        \end{cases}
    \]
    Then, $\vec x' \in B \cap Y$. Thus, by \Cref{th:inClosureIffNeighCapANonempty},
    $\cl Y = X$. By \Cref{th:connIfBtwAandClA}, $X$ is connected.
}

\exmp{$\RR[\omega]$ in the Box Topology is Disconnected}{
    Let
    \[
        \begin{aligned}[t]
            A &= \{\,\vec x \in \RR[\omega] \mid \vec x \text{ is bounded}\,\}\text{ and} \\
            B &= \{\,\vec x \in \RR[\omega] \mid \vec x \text{ is unbounded}\,\}\text{.}  \\
        \end{aligned}
    \]
    If $\vec a$ is in either $A$ or $B$, $\prod_{i \in \ZZ_+} (a_i - 1, a_i + 1)$
    is an open set that is contained in either $A$ or $B$.
    Thus, each $A$ and $B$ are disjoint open sets in $\RR[\omega]$
    whose union is $\RR[\omega]$.
