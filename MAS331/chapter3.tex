\dfn{Separation and Connectedness}{
    Let $X$ be a topological space.
    A \textit{separation} of $X$ is a pair $U$ and $V$
    of subsets of $X$ which satisfy the following.
    \begin{enumerate}[nolistsep, label=(\roman*)]
        \ii $U$ and $V$ are open in $X$.
        \ii $U \cap V = \varnothing$.
        \ii $U \cup V = X$.
    \end{enumerate}
    The space $X$ is said to be \textit{connected}
    if there does not exist a separation of $X$.
}
\nt{
    Connectedness ia a topological property.
}
\nt{
    A space $X$ is connected if and only if the only subsets of $X$
    that are both open and closed in $X$ are the empty sets and $X$ itself.
}

\mlemma[sepIffNotContainLimPts]{}{
    If $Y$ is a subspace of $X$,
    $A, B \subseteq Y$ is a separation of $Y$
    if and only if $A \cap B = \varnothing$, $A \cup B = Y$,
    and neither $A$ nor $B$ contains a limit point of the other.
}
\pf{Proof}{
    Suppose $A$ and $B$ form a separation of $Y$.
    Then, $A$ is both open and closed in $Y$; thus
    the closure of $A$ in $Y$ is $\cl A \cap Y = A$
    by \Cref{th:closureSubspace}.
    In other words, $\cl A \cap B = \varnothing$.
    Similarly, $A \cap \cl B = \varnothing$. \checkmark

    Suppose $A$ and $B$ are disjoint subsets of $Y$ whose union is $Y$
    and $A \cap B' = A' \cap B = \varnothing$.
    Thus, $A \cap \cl B = \cl A \cap B = \varnothing$.
    This implies $\cl A \cap Y = A$ and $\cl B \cap Y = B$; $A$ and $B$ are closed in $Y$,
    and thus they are open in $Y$ as well.
}

\mlemma[connInDisconn]{}{
    If the sets $C$ and $D$ form a separation of a space $X$,
    and if $Y$ is a connected subspace of $X$,
    then $Y$ lies entirely within $C$ or $D$.
}
\pf{Proof}{
    $C \cap Y$ and $D \cap Y$ are open in $Y$.
    Also, $(C \cap Y) \cup (D \cap Y) = (C \cup D) \cap Y = Y$.
    If they were both unempty, they would form a separation of $Y$.
    Thus, one of them is empty; $Y$ is entirely in the other.
}

\thm[UconnIfHaveCommonPt]{}{
    Let $X$ be a topological space.
    Let $\{A_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in J}$ be a family of connected subspaces of $X$.
    If $\bigcap_{\alpha \in J} A_\alpha \neq \varnothing$,
    then $\bigcup_{\alpha \in J} A_\alpha$ is connected.
}
\pf{Proof}{
    Take any $p \in \bigcap_{\alpha \in J} A_\alpha$.
    Suppose $C$ and $D$ form a separation of $Y = \bigcup_{\alpha \in J} A_\alpha$.
    \textsf{WLOG}, $p \in C$.
    For each $\alpha \in J$, since $p \in C \cap A_\alpha$,
    by \Cref{lem:connInDisconn}, $A_\alpha \subseteq C$.
    Thus, $\bigcup_{\alpha \in J} A_\alpha \subseteq C$,
    contradicting that $D \cap Y \neq \varnothing$.
}

\thm[connIfBtwAandClA]{}{
    Let $A$ be a connected subspace of $X$.
    If $A \subseteq B \subseteq \cl A$,
    then $B$ is also connected.
}
\pf{Proof}{
    Suppose $B = C \cup D$ is a separation of $B$
    for the sake of contradiction.
    By \Cref{lem:connInDisconn}, \textsf{WLOG}, $A \subseteq C$.
    Then, $B \subseteq \cl A \subseteq \cl C$.
    Since $\cl C \cap D = \varnothing$ by \Cref{lem:sepIffNotContainLimPts},
    $B \cap D = \varnothing$, which makes $C$ and $D$ not form a separation, \#.
}

\thm[contiSendsConnToConn]{Connected Space and Continuous Map}{
    Let $f \colon X \to Y$ be a continuous map.
    If $X$ is connected, then $\Img f$ is connected.
}
\pf{Proof}{
    Note that the surjective map $g \colon X \to \Img f$ obtained by
    restricting the codomain of $f$ is also continuous by \Cref{th:constructConti}.
    Suppose $\Img f = A \cup B$ is a separation of $\Img f$.
    Then, $g\inv(A)$ and $g\inv(B)$ are open and disjoint sets in $X$
    whose union is $X$, which is a contradiction to the connectedness of $X$.

\thm[finProdConnIsConn]{Connected Space and Finite Product}{
    Let $\{X_i\}_{i=1}^n$ be a finite family of connected spaces.
    then,
    \[
        X = \prod_{i=1}^n X_i
    \] is connected.
}
\pf{Proof}{
    It is enough to prove for two connected spaces $X$ and $Y$;
    extension to finite products can be done inductively.
    We may assume $X$ and $Y$ are nonempty.
    Take any $a \times b \in X \times Y$.
    Let $x \in X$.
    $X \times \{b\}$ and $\{x\} \times Y$ as subspaces of $X \times Y$
    are connected since they are homeomorphic with $X$ and $Y$, respectively.
    Thus,
    \[
        T_x = (X \times \{b\}) \cup (\{x\} \times Y)
    \] is connected by \Cref{th:UconnIfHaveCommonPt}, having
    $x \times b$ as a common point of two spaces.
    Thus, \[
        X \times Y = \bigcup_{x \in X} T_x
    \] is connected as they have a point $a \times b$ in common.
}

\thm[arbProdConnIsConn]{Connected Space and Product Topology}{
    Let $\{X_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in J}$ be a family of connected spaces.
    Then,
    \[
        X = \prod_{\alpha \in J} X_{\alpha}
    \] is connected in the product topology.
}
\pf{Proof}{
    We may assume that $X_\alpha \neq \varnothing$ for each $\alpha \in J$.
    Let $\vec a = (a_\alpha)_{\alpha \in J}$ be a fixed point of $X$.

    We first note that, given any finite subset $K$ of $J$,
    $X_K \triangleq \{\,(x_\alpha)_{\alpha \in J} \mid
    \forall \alpha \in J \setminus K,\: x_\alpha = a_\alpha\,\}$
    is a connected subspace of $X$ as $X_K$ is homeomorphic with $\prod_{\alpha \in K} X_\alpha$,
    which is connected by \Cref{th:finProdConnIsConn}.
    Note that $Y \triangleq \bigcup \{\,X_K \mid K \subseteq J \text{ and } K \text{ is finite}\,\}$
    as a subspace of $X$ is connected since $\vec a \in X_K$ for every finite $K \subseteq J$.

    Let $\vec x \in X$ and $B = \bigcap_{i=1}^n \pi_{\alpha_i}\inv(U_{\alpha_i})$ be
    any basis that contains $\vec x$ where $\alpha_i \in J$ for each $i \in [n]$.
    Define $\vec x' \in X$ be
    \[
        (\vec x')_{\alpha} \triangleq \begin{cases}
            x_\alpha & \text{if } \alpha = \alpha_i \text{ for some } i \in [n] \\
            a_\alpha & \text{otherwise.}
        \end{cases}
    \]
    Then, $\vec x' \in B \cap Y$. Thus, by \Cref{th:inClosureIffNeighCapANonempty},
    $\cl Y = X$. By \Cref{th:connIfBtwAandClA}, $X$ is connected.
}

\exmp{$\RR[\omega]$ in the Box Topology is Disconnected}{
    Let
    \[
        \begin{aligned}[t]
            A &= \{\,\vec x \in \RR[\omega] \mid \vec x \text{ is bounded}\,\}\text{ and} \\
            B &= \{\,\vec x \in \RR[\omega] \mid \vec x \text{ is unbounded}\,\}\text{.}  \\
        \end{aligned}
    \]
    If $\vec a$ is in either $A$ or $B$, $\prod_{i \in \ZZ_+} (a_i - 1, a_i + 1)$
    is an open set that is contained in either $A$ or $B$.
    Thus, each $A$ and $B$ are disjoint open sets in $\RR[\omega]$
    whose union is $\RR[\omega]$.

\dfn[defLinConti]{Linear Continuum}{
    A simply ordered set $L$ having more than one element
    is called \textit{linear continuum} if the following hold:
    \begin{enumerate}[nolistsep, label=(\roman*)]
        \ii $L$ has the least upper bound property.
        \ii $\forall x, y \in L,\: (x < y \implies \exs z \in L,\: x < z < y)$.

\nt{
    $\RR$ is a linear continuum.

\exmp[orderSqIsLinConti]{The Ordered Square is a Linear Continuum}{
    Let $I = [0, 1]$ and $I_0^2 = I \times I$ be the ordered square
    with the dictionary ordering.
    \begin{enumerate}[nolistsep, label=(\roman*)]
        \ii Let $\varnothing \neq A \subseteq I_0^2$ and $\pi_1 \colon I_0^2 \to I$
            be the projection onto its first factor.
            Then, $\pi_1(A)$ is bounded above by $1$.
            Let $b \triangleq \sup \pi_1(A)$. ($[0, 1]$ has l.u.b. property.)
            
            If $b \in A$, it implies that $A \cap (\{b\} \times I) \neq \varnothing$
            and is bounded above by $1$.
            Thus, we may let $c \triangleq \sup \big(A \cap (\{b\} \times I)\big)$.
            One may readily check that $\sup A_0 = b \times c$.

            If $b \neq A_0$, then $b \times 0$ is

\thm[linContiIsConn]{}{
    If $L$ is a linear continuum in the order topology,
    any convex subspace of $L$ is connected.
}
\pf{Proof}{
    Let $Y$ be a convex subspace of $L$.
    Suppose $Y = A \cup B$ is a separation of $Y$ for the sake of contradiction.
    Take any $a \in A$ and $b \in B$. \textsf{WLOG}, $a < b$.
    $[a, b] \subseteq Y$ as $Y$ is convex,
    and $[a, b]$ as a subspace of $Y$ is exactly $[a, b]$ in the order topology
    by \Cref{th:convexThenSubspaceIsOrder}.
    Hence,
    \[
        A_0 \triangleq A \cap [a, b] \quad\text{and}\quad
        B_0 \triangleq B \cap [a, b]
    \]
    form a separation of $[a, b]$.

    Let $c \triangleq \sup A_0$. Then, $c \ge a$ as $a \in A_0$, and
    $c \le b$ as, if $c$ were larger than $b$,
    there would be $z \in L$ such that $b < z < c$,
    which is an upper bound of $A_0$ smaller than $c$.
    However, we claim that $c \notin A_0 \cup B_0 = [a, b]$,
    which leads to a contradiction.

    ($c \notin A_0$) Suppose $c \in A_0$ for the sake of contradiction.
    Since $A_0$ is open in $[a, b]$,
    there must exist $e \in (c, b]$ such that $[c, e) \subseteq A_0$.
    ($e$ cannot be larger than $b$ as $b \notin A_0$.)
    As the existence of $e' \in (c, e) \cap L$ is guaranteed
    and such $e'$ is in $A_0$, $c$ is no longer an upper bound of $A_0$, \#.

    ($c \notin B_0$) Suppose $c \in B_0$ for the sake of contradiction.
    Since $B_0$ is open in $[a, b]$,
    there exists $e \in [a, c)$ such that $(e, c] \subseteq B_0$.
    ($e$ cannot be smaller than $a$ as $a \notin B_0$.)
    Since, $(c, \infty) \cap A_0 = \varnothing$ as $c$ is the supremum of $A_0$,
    $e$ is an upper bound of $A_0$ that is smaller than $c$, \#.

\thm[ivt]{Intermediate Value Theorem}{

    Let $f \colon X \to Y$ be a continuous map.
    Then, if $a, b \in X$ and $r \in Y$ satisfy $f(a) \le r \le f(b)$,
    there exists $c \in X$ such that $f(c) = r$.
}
\pf{Proof}{
    If $f(a) = r$ or $f(b) = r$, then done.
    So suppose $f(a) < r < f(b)$.
    $\Img f$ is connected by \Cref{th:contiSendsConnToConn}.
    Let
    \[
        A \triangleq \Img f \cap (-\infty, r) \quad\text{ and }\quad
        B \triangleq \Img f \cap (r, \infty)\text{.}
    \]   
    Then, $A$ and $B$ are open in $\Img f$ and $f(a) \in A$ and $f(b) \in B$.
    Thus, it cannot happen that $\Img f \setminus \{r\} = A \cup B = \Img f$ since $\Img f$ is connected.
    Therefore, $r \in \Img f$.

\dfn{Path and Path Connectedness}{
    Let $X$ be a space.
    Given $x, y \in X$, a \textit{path} in $X$

    $f(a) = x$, and $f(b) = y$.
    The space $X$ is \textit{path connected}

    We have a line that connects $\vec x$ and $\vec x'$

\thm[pathConnIsConn]{}{
    Every path connected space is connected.
}
\pf{Proof}{
    Let $X$ be a path connected space.
    If $X = \varnothing$, it is done; let $X \neq \varnothing$.
    Take $x \in X$.
    For each $y \in X$, let $f_y \colon [0, 1] \to X$
    be a path from $x$ to $y$.
    Since $[0, 1]$ is connected (\Cref{cor:RisConn}),
    $\Img f_y$ is connected by \Cref{th:contiSendsConnToConn}.
    As $x \in \bigcap_{y \in X} \Img f_y$,

\exmp{Connectedness Does Not Imply Path Connectedness}{
    By \Cref{exmp:orderSqIsLinConti}, $I_0^2$ is connected.
    Suppose $I_0^2$ is path connected for the sake of contradiction.
    Then, there is a path $f \colon [0, 1] \to I_0^2$ from $0 \times 0$ to $1 \times 1$.
    \Cref{th:ivt} says that $\Img f = I_0^2$.
    For each $x \in I$, let $U_x = f\inv(\{x\} \times I)$.
    Note that $U_x \neq \varnothing$.
    Since each $U_x$ is open as $f$ is continuous,
    by the denseness of $\QQ$ in $\RR$, there exists
    $q_x \in U_x \cap \QQ$ for each $x \in X$.
    This implies the existence of a injection $g \colon I \to \QQ$
    defined by $x \mapsto q_x$,
    which is a contradiction as $I$ is uncountable. (\Cref{th:countSetTFAE})

\thm[contiSendsPathConnToPathConn]{Path Connected Space and Continuous Map}{

    There exist $x_1, x_2 \in X$ such that $f(x_1) = y_1$ and $f(x_2) = y_2$.
    Since $X$ is connected, there exists a continuous map
    $g \colon [0, 1] \to X$ such that $g(0) = x_1$ and $g(1) = x_2$.
    Then, $f \circ g \colon [0, 1] \to \Img f$ is
    a continuous map such that $(f \circ g)(0) = y_1$ and $(f \circ g)(1) = y_2$

    Then, the map $g \colon \RR[n] \setminus \{\vec 0\} \to S^{n-1}$ defined by
    $\vec x \mapsto \vec x / \|\vec x\|$ is a continuous surjective map.
    Moreover, if $n > 1$, since $\RR[n] \setminus \{0\}$
    is path connected (\Cref{exmp:puncturedEuclIsPathConn}),
    $S^{n-1} = \Img g$ is also path connected by \Cref{th:contiSendsPathConnToPathConn}.

        S \triangleq \left\{\, x \times \sin \frac{1}{x} \in \RR[2] \:\bigg|\: x \in (0, 1] \right\}\text{.}
    \]
    Since $S$ is a image of $(0, 1]$ under a continuous map $x \mapsto x \times \sin (1/x)$,
    $S$ is (path) connected.
    Thus, $\cl S$ is connected by \Cref{th:connIfBtwAandClA}.
    Note that $S_0 \triangleq \cl S \setminus S = \{0\} \times [-1, 1]$.
    ($S_0$ is also closed.)

    Suppose $\cl S$ is path connected for the sake of contradiction.
    Then, there is a path $f \colon [0, 1] \to \cl S$ from $0 \times 0$ to $f(1) \in S$.
    $f\inv(S_0)$ is closed in $[0, 1]$ by \Cref{th:contiTFAE}.
    Hence $b \triangleq \sup f\inv(S_0) \in f\inv(S_0)$ and $b \neq 1$.
    $f(b) \in S_0$ and $f((b, 1]) \subseteq S$.

    Reparametrize $f \colon [0, 1] \to \cl S$ so that
    $t \mapsto x(t) \times y(t)$; $f(0) \in S_0$ and $f((0, 1]) \subseteq S$.
    ($y(t) = \sin (1/x(t))$)
    Since $x(t) > 0$ for $t \in (0, 1]$, $x$ is continuous, and $x(0) = 0$,
    we may construct a sequence $\{t_n\}_{n \in \ZZ_+}$ such that
    \[
        \lim_{n \to \infty} t_n = 0\text{,} \quad

    However, $\{y(t_n)\}_{n \in \ZZ_+}$ diverges
    although $y$ is continuous and $t_n \to 0$.
    Thus, $\cl S$ is not path connected.

    There are connected subspaces $U$ and $V$ such that $x, y \in U$ and $y, z \in V$.

\pf{Proof}{
    If $A = \varnothing$, it is done; suppose $A \neq \varnothing$.

    Let $C_\alpha$ and $C_\beta$ be connected components.
    If $A \cap C_\alpha \neq \varnothing$ and $A \cap C_\beta \neq \varnothing$,
    we may take $x \in A \cap C_\alpha$ and $y \in A \cap C_\beta$,

    This implies $x_\alpha \sim x_\beta$
    for all $x_\alpha \in C_\alpha$ and $x_\beta \in C_\beta$;
    thus $C_\alpha = C_\beta$.

    Now, take any $\alpha \in A$.
    Since $\{C_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in J}$ is a partition of $X$,

    by the previous claim.
    Hence, $[a, y] = [a, c] \cup [c, y]$ can be covered by
    finitely many elements of $\mcal A$ since $c \in C$.
    This implies $y \in C$, contradicting that
    $c$ is an upper bound of $C$, \#. \checkmark

\cor[cldIntvInRIsCpt]{}{
    Every closed interval in $\RR$ is compact.

\thm[cptInRnIffCldAndBdd]{}{
    A subspace $A$ of $\RR[n]$ is compact if and only if
    it is closed and it is bounded in the Euclidean metrid $d$
    or the square metric $\rho$.
}
\pf{Proof}{
    It suffices to prove only for $\rho$
    as $A$ is bounded in $d$ if and only if $A$ is bounded in $\rho$.
    (See the proof of \Cref{th:eucliAndSqareMetricAreProduct}.)

    ($\Rightarrow$)
    By \Cref{th:cptInHausIsCld}, $A$ is closed. \checkmark

    The collection
    \[
        \{\,B_{\rho}(\vec 0, m) \mid m \in \ZZ_+\,\}
    \]
    is an open covering of $A$.
    Thus, $A \subseteq B_{\rho}(\vec 0, M)$ for some $M$.
    Therefore, $\rho(\vec x, \vec y) \le 2M$ for each $\vec x, \vec y \in A$.
    Thus, $A$ is bounded. \checkmark

    ($\Leftarrow$)
    There exists $M \in \RR_+$ such that
    $\rho(\vec x, \vec y) \le M$ for each $\vec x, \vec y \in A$.
    Choose a point $\vec x_0 \in A$, and let $b \triangleq \rho(\vec x_0, \vec 0)$.
    Then, $\rho(\vec x, \vec 0) \le P \triangleq N + b$ for every $\vec x \in A$.
    Thus, $A \subseteq [-P, P]^n$.
    $[-P, P]^n$ is compact by
    \Cref{cor:cldIntvInRIsCpt}, \Cref{th:prodCptIffEachCpt}, and \Cref{th:subOfProdIsProdOfSub}.
    Since $A$ is closed in $[-P, P]^n$ and $[-P, P]^n$ is compact,
    $A$ is compact by \Cref{th:cldInCptIsCpt}.

\thm[evt]{Extreme Value Theorem}{
    Let $X$ be a compact set and
    $Y$ be an ordered set endowed by the order topology.
    Let $f \colon X \to y$ be a continuous map.
    Then, there exist $c, d \in X$ such that
    $f(c) \le f(x) \le f(d)$ for all $x \in X$.

\pf{Proof}{
    Suppose $\Img f$ does not have a maximum.
    Then,
    \[
        \{\, (-\infty, a) \subseteq \RR \mid a \in \Img f\,\}

    is an open covering of $\Img f$.
    Since $\Img f$ is compact by \Cref{th:contiSendsCptToCpt},

\dfn{Distance From a Point to a Set}{
    Let $(X, d)$ be a metric space and let $\varnothing \neq A \subseteq X$.
    For each $x \in X$, we define the
    \textit{distance from $x$ to $A$} by the equation
    \[
        d(x, A) \triangleq \inf \{\,d(x, a) \mid a \in A\,\}\text{.}

\thm[distFtnIsConti]{}{
    Let $(X, d)$ be a metric space and let $\varnothing \neq A \subseteq X$.
    Then, $f \colon X \to \RR$ defined by
    \[
        f(x) \triangleq d(x, A)
    \]
    is uniformly continuous.
}
\pf{Proof}{
    Take any $\veps \in \RR_+$ and let $\delta \triangleq \veps$.
    For any $x, y \in X$ and $a \in A$ with $d(x, y) < \veps$,
    we have $d(x, A) \le (x, a) \le d(x, y) + d(y, a)$.
    Thus,
    \[
        d(x, A) - d(x, y) \le \inf_{a \in A} d(y, a) = d(y, A)\text{,}

    which implies $|d(x, A) - d(y, A)| \le d(x, y) < \veps = \delta$.

\mlemma[lebesgueN]{The Lebesgue Number Lemma}{
