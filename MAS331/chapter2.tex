\section{Basis for a Topology}
\dfn[defBasis]{Basis and Toplogy Generated by a Basis}{
	A \textit{basis} for $X$ is a collection $\mcal B$ of subsets of $X$ such that:

		$x \in B_1 \subseteq U_1$ and $x \in B_2 \subseteq U_2$.

\pf{Proof}{
    We will exploit \Cref{lem:topToBasis}.
    Take any open set $W \subseteq X \times Y$ and $x \times y \in W$.

    such that $x \times y \in U \times V \subseteq W$.
    Since $U$ and $V$ are open in $X$ and $Y$, respectively, and $x \in U$ and $y \in V$,
    there are $B \in \mcal B$ and $C \in \mcal C$ such that $x \in B \subseteq U$ and $y \in C \subseteq V$.

    Here, we find that $x \times y \in B \times C \subseteq U \times V \subseteq W$ while $B \times C \in \mcal D$.

\wc{Order Topology and Subspace Topology}{
    Unlike product topology and subspace topology, order topology and subspace topology are not associative.
    Let $X$ be an ordered set and $Y \subseteq X$. \[
        \setlength\arraycolsep{1pt}
        \begin{array}{r@{\qquad}c}
            \text{(i)} & Y \xrightarrow{\text{order}} Y \\
            \text{(ii)} & X \xrightarrow{\text{order}} X \xrightarrow{\text{subspace}} Y \subseteq X
        \end{array}
    \] Then, will those be the same?
    \paragraph*{Example 1.} Consider $X = \RR$ and $Y = [0, 1]$.
    Then, the subspace topology of the order topology $X$ has a basis of \[
        \mcal B_{[0,1]} = \{\, [0, 1] \cap (a, b) \mid a < b \,\}\text{,}
    \] which is in fact the order topology on $Y$. In this case, $\text{(i)}=\text{(ii)}$.
    \paragraph*{Example 2.} Consider $X = \RR$ and $Y = [0, 1) \cup \{2\}$.
    Then, $\{2\}$ is an open in (ii) since $\{2\} = Y \cap (1.5, 2.5)$.
    But, there is no basis of the order topology on $Y$ such that contains $2$ and is a subset of $\{2\}$.
    Thus, in this case, $\text{(i)} \neq \text{(ii)}$.
    \paragraph*{Example 3.} Consider $X = \RR[2]$ and $Y = I^2$ where $I = [0, 1]$.
    Then, $\{1/2\} \times (1/2, 1]$ is an open set in (ii) since it is $\big(\{1/2\} \times (1/2,3/2)\big) \cap I^2$.
    But it is not an open set in (i) since there is no basis that contain $(1/2, 1)$ and is a subset of $\{1/2\} \times (1/2, 1]$.
}

\dfn{Convex Subset}{
    Given an ordered set $X$ and $Y \subseteq X$,
    $Y$ is called \textit{convex} if \[
        \forall a, b \in Y,\: \big(a < b \implies (a, b) \subseteq Y\big)\text{.}
    \]
}

\thm{}{
    Let $X$ be an ordered set with the ordered topology. If $Y \subseteq X$ is convex,
    then the order topology on $Y$ is the same as the subspace topology.
}
\pf{Proof}{
    We will make use of the fact that open rays form a subbasis that generates the order topology.
    
    First, every open ray of (i) is an open ray of the subspace (ii). \[
        \{\, x \in Y \mid x > a \,\} = \{\, x \in X \cap Y \mid x > a \,\}\text{,}
    \] for example. Therefore, (ii) is finer than (i).

    Now, take any open ray in $X$, $(a, \infty)_X = \{\, x \in X \mid x > a \,\}$, for instance.
    Then, let \[
        \begin{aligned}[t]
            R &\triangleq (a, \infty)_X \cap Y \\
              &= \{\, y \in Y \mid y > a \,\} = (a, \infty)_Y\text{.}
        \end{aligned}
    \]

    If $a \in Y$, then $R$ is an open ray in $Y$.

    Now consider the case $a \notin Y$. If $R$ is nonempty then there is some $y_0 \in R$.
    Take any $y \in Y$. If $y_0 < y$, then $y \in R$ since $a < y_0 < y$.
    If $y < y_0$, it implies $a < y < y_0$ because $y < a < y_0$ with $y, y_0 \in Y$ implies
    $a \in Y$ by the convexity of $Y$. Therefore, $y \in R$.
    So, if $a \notin Y$, it is either $R = \varnothing$ or $R = Y$.

    Combining the cases, we get the fact that the intersection of $Y$ and an arbitrary open ray in $X$
    is an open ray in $Y$, an empty set, or the whole $Y$.

    This is the final step. Take any open set $U$ in the ordered topology $X$.
    Then, $U = \bigcup_{\alpha \in J} U_\alpha$ where $U_\alpha \neq \varnothing$ is a finite intersection of open rays in $X$.
    Noting that $U \cap Y$ is a general form of an open set in $Y$,
    we get $U \cap Y = \bigcup_{\alpha \in J} (U_\alpha \cap Y)$, which implies either $U \cap Y = Y$ or
    $U \cap Y$ is a union of finite intersections of an open ray in $Y$.

\cor{}{
    Let $X$ be an ordered set with the ordered topology.
    The subspace topology of $Y \subseteq X$ is finer than the order topology on $Y$.

\section{Continuous Functions}

\dfn{Continuity of a Function}{
    Let $X$ and $Y$ be topological spaces.
    A function $f \colon X \to Y$ is said to be \textit{continuous}

\nt{
    To prove a function $f \colon X \to Y$ is continuous,
    it is enough to prove that every basis of $Y$
    has an open preimage in $X$.

    it follows that
    \[
        f\inv(V) = \bigcup_{\alpha \in J}f\inv(B_\alpha)
    \] is open in $X$.

    If the toplogy on $Y$ is given by a subbasis,
    it is even sufficient to prove every preimage of subbasis element is open.
    Then, for every basis $B = \bigcap_{i=1}^n S_i$, it follows that
    \[
        f\inv(B) = \bigcap_{i=1}^n f\inv(S_i)

        \ii For each $x \in X$ and each neighborhood $V$ of $f(x)$,
            there is a neighborhood $U$ of $x$ such that $f(U) \subseteq V$.
    \end{enumerate}

\pf{Proof}{
    ((i) $\Longrightarrow$ (ii))
    Take any $x \in \cl A$.
    Let $V$ be any neighborhood of $f(x)$.
    Then, $f\inv(V)$ is a neighborhood of $x$.
    Since $x \in \cl A$, by \Cref{th:inClosureIffNeighCapANonempty},
    $f\inv(V)$ intersects $A$; $A \cap f\inv(V) \neq \varnothing$.
    Therefore, since $\varnothing \neq f(A \cap f\inv(V)) = f(A) \cap f(f\inv(V)) \subseteq f(A) \cap V$,
    $V$ intersects $f(A)$; by \Cref{th:inClosureIffNeighCapANonempty},
    $f(x) \in \cl{f(A)}$ as $V$ was arbitrary.
    Therefore, $f(\cl A) \subseteq \cl{f(A)}$.

    ((ii) $\Longrightarrow$ (iii))
    Let $B$ be closed in $Y$ and let $A \triangleq f\inv(B)$.
    Then, $f(A) = f(f\inv(B)) \subseteq B$.
    Therefore, if $x \in \cl A$,
    $f(x) \in f(\cl A) \subseteq \cl{f(A)} \subseteq \cl B = B$;
    which implies $x \in f\inv(B) = A$.
    This means $\cl A \subseteq A$, thus $A$ is closed.

    ((iii) $\Longrightarrow$ (i))
    Let $V$ be an open set of $Y$. Let $B \triangleq Y \setminus B$. Then
    \[
        f\inv(B) = f\inv(Y) \setminus f\inv(V) = X \setminus f\inv(V)
    \]
    is closed as $B$ is closed. Thus, $f\inv(V) = X \setminus f\inv(B)$ is open.

    ((i) $\Longrightarrow$ (iv))
    For every neighborhood $V$ of $f(x)$,
    $U=f\inv(V)$ is the neighborhood of $x$ that satisfies $f(U) \subseteq V$.

    ((iv) $\Longrightarrow$ (i))
    Let $V$ be an open set of $Y$. Then, for each $x \in f\inv(V)$,
    since $V$ is a neighborhood of $f(x)$,
    there exists a neighborhood $U_x$ of $x$ that satisfies $f(U_x) \subseteq V$.
    Then, $U_x \subseteq f\inv(f(U_x)) \subseteq f\inv(V)$.
    Therfore, $f\inv(V) = \bigcup_{x \in f\inv(V)} U_x$ is open in $X$.

    So, $f$ is a homeomorphism if and only if
    it is a bijection such that $U \subseteq X$ is open in $X$
    if and only if $f(U)$ is open in $Y$.
}

\nt{
    If $f$ is a homeomorphism between $X$ and $Y$,
    then $\mcal T_Y = \{\,f(U) \mid U \in \mcal T_X\,\}$ and
    $\mcal T_X = \{\,f\inv(V) \mid V \in \mcal T_X\,\}$.

    Therefore, any property of $X$ that is entirely expressed
    in terms of the topology of $X$ yields,
    via the correspondence $f$,
    the corresponding property for the space $Y$.
    Such a property of $X$ is called \textit{topological property} of $X$.\\[1em]

\subsection{Constructing Continuous Functions}

\thm[constructConti]{Rules for Constructing Continuous Functions}{
    Let $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ be topological spaces.
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
        \ii (\textit{Constant Function})
            If $f \colon X \to Y$ has a singleton $f(X)$,
            $f$ is continuous.
        \ii (\textit{Inclusion})
            If $A$ is a subspace of $X$,
            the inclusion function $j \colon A \to X$ is continuous.
        \ii (\textit{Composites})
            If $f \colon X \to Y$ and $g \colon Y \to Z$ are continuous,
            then the map $g \circ f$ is continuous.
        \ii (\textit{Restricting the Domain})
            If $f \colon X \to Y$ is continuous,
            and if $A$ is a subspace of $X$,
            then the restricted function $f \big|_A \colon A \to Y$ is continuous.
        \ii (\textit{Restricting or Expanding the Codomain})
            Let $f \colon X \to Y$ be continuous.
            If $Z$ is a subspace of $Y$ and $f(X) \subseteq Z$,
            then the function $g \colon X \to Z$ obtained by restricting the range of $f$ is continuous.
            If $Z$ is a space having $Y$ as a subspace,
            then the function $h \colon X \to Z$ obtained by expanding the range of $f$ is continuous.
        \ii (\textit{Local Formulation of Continuity})
            The map $f \colon X \to Y$ is continuous
            if $X$ is a union of open sets $U_\alpha$
            such that $f \big|_{U_\alpha}$ is continuous for each $\alpha$.
    \end{enumerate}
}
\pf{Proof}{
    $ $\\[-1em]
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
        \ii Let $f(x) = y_0$ for every $x \in X$ for some fixed $y_0 \in Y$.
            Then, for each (open) set $V \subseteq Y$,
            \[
                f\inv(V) = \begin{cases}
                    X           & \text{if } y_0 \in V    \\
                    \varnothing & \text{if } y_0 \notin V
                \end{cases}
            \]
            is always open in $X$.
        \ii If $U$is open in $X$, then $f\inv(U) = U \cap A$ is open in $A$ (by definition).
        \ii If $U$ is open in $Z$, then $g\inv(U)$ is open in $Y$,
            and thus $(g \circ f)\inv(U) = f\inv(g\inv(U))$ is open in $X$.
        \ii $f \big|_A = f \circ j$ where $j \colon A \to X$ is the inclusion function.
            Therefore, $f \big|_A$ is continuous by (ii) and (iii).
        \ii First, suppose $f(X) \subseteq Z \subseteq Y$.
            Take any open set $W \subseteq Z$ of $Z$.
            Then, $W = V \cap Z$ for some open set $V$ in $Y$.
            Because $f(X) \subseteq Z$ and $f(x) = g(x)$ for all $x \in X$,
            \[
                f\inv(V) = f\inv(V \cap Z) = f\inv(W) = g\inv(W)\text{.}
            \] Thus, $g\inv(W)$ is open in $X$ as $f$ is continuous.

            We get $h$ is continuous from noting that
            $h = j \circ f$ where $j \colon Y \to Z$ is the inclusion function.
        \ii Let $X = \bigcup_{\alpha \in J} U_\alpha$ in which,
            for each $\alpha \in J$, $U_\alpha$ is an open set in $X$
            such that $f \big|_{U_\alpha}$ is continuous.
            Let $V$ be an open set in $Y$. Then
            \[
                f\inv(V) \cap U_\alpha = \big(f\big|_{U_\alpha}\big)\inv(V)
            \] for each $\alpha \in J$;
            $f\inv(V) \cap U_\alpha$ is open in $X$
            since $f \big|_{U_\alpha}$ is continuous.
            Therefore,
            \[
                f\inv(V) = f\inv(V) \cap X
                = f\inv(V) \cap \left(\bigcup_{\alpha \in J} U_\alpha\right)
                = \bigcup_{\alpha \in J} \big(f\inv(V) \cap U_\alpha\big)
            \] is open in $X$.

\thm[pasting]{The Pasting Lemma}{
    Let $X = A \cup B$ be a topological space, where $A$ and $B$ are closed in $B$.
    Let $f \colon A \to Y$ and $g \colon B \to Y$ be continuous.

    then the function $h \colon X \to Y$ defined by

\pf{Proof}{
    Let $C$ be a closed subset of $Y$. Now
    \[
        f\inv(C) = f\inv(C) \cup g\inv(C)\text{.}
    \] Since $f$ and $g$ are continuous and $C$ is closed,
    $f\inv(C)$ and $g\inv(C)$ are closed by \Cref{th:contiEquiv}.
    Thus, $h\inv(C)$ is closed.
}

\nt{
    \Cref{th:pasting} holds if $A$ and $B$ are both open.
    It is, nonetheless, a special case of (vi) of \Cref{th:constructConti}.
}

\nt{
    \Cref{th:pasting} does not hold if $A$ is open and $B$ is closed.
    For instance, the function $h \colon A \cup B \to \RR$,
    where $A = (-\infty, 0)$ and $B = [0, \infty)$,
    defined by \[
        h(x) \triangleq \begin{cases}
            x - 2 & \text{if } x \in A \\
            x + 2 & \text{if } x \in B

    since $h\inv((1, 3)) = [0, 1)$ is not open.
}

\thm[contiIffCoordsConti]{Maps Into Products}{

    Then $f$ is continuous if and only if the functions
    \[
        f_1 \colon A \to X \quad \text{and} \quad f_2 \colon A \to Y
    \]
    are continuous.
}
\pf{Proof}{
    ($\Rightarrow$)
    We first show that the projections
    $\pi_1 \colon X \times Y \to X$ and $\pi_2 \colon X \times Y \to Y$
    are continuous.
    For each open sets $U \subseteq X$ and $V \subseteq Y$,
    $\pi_1\inv(U) = U \times Y$ and $\pi_2\inv(V) = X \times V$
    are open; $\pi_1$ and $\pi_2$ are continuous.

    Then, noting that $f_1 = \pi_1 \circ f$ and $f_2 = \pi_2 \circ f$,
    we conlcude $f_1$ and $f_2$ are continuous.

    ($\Leftarrow$)
    For any basis element $U \times V$ in $X \times Y$,
    \[
        \begin{aligned}[t]
            f\inv(U \times V) &= \{\,a \in A \mid f(a) \in U \times V\,\} \\
                              &= \{\,a \in A \mid f_1(a) \in U \text{ and } f_2(a) \in V\,\} \\
                              &= f_1\inv(U) \cap f_2\inv(V)\text{.}
        \end{aligned}
    \]
    Thus, $f\inv(U \times V)$ is open since $f_1\inv(U)$ and $f_2\inv(V)$ are open.

\section{The Product Topology}

\dfn{Box Topology}{
    Let $\{X_{\alpha}\}_{\alpha \in J}$ be an indexed family of topological spaces.
    The topology generated by the basis
    \[
        \mcal B = \left\{\,\prod_{\alpha \in J} U_\alpha \:\bigg|\:
                           \forall \alpha \in J,\: U_\alpha \text{ is open in } X_\alpha \,\right\}
    \]
    for the product $\prod_{\alpha \in J} X_\alpha$
    is called the \textit{box topology}.
}
\nt{
    The collection $\mcal B$ is indeed a basis for $\prod_{\alpha \in J} X_\alpha$.
    $\bigcup \mcal B = \prod_{\alpha \in J} X_\alpha$ holds since
    $\prod_{\alpha \in J} X_\alpha \in \mcal B$.
    Also, an intersection of two basis elements is another basis element.
    This can be shown by
    \[
        \left(\prod_{\alpha \in J} U_\alpha\right) \cap \left(\prod_{\alpha \in J} V_\alpha\right)
        = \prod_{\alpha \in J} \big(U_\alpha \cap V_\alpha\big)\text{.}
    \]
}

\dfn{Projection}{
    Let $\{X_{\alpha}\}_{\alpha \in J}$ be an indexed family of sets. Let
    \[
        \pi_{\beta} \colon \prod_{\alpha \in J} X_\alpha \to X_\beta
    \]
    be defined by
    \[
        (x_\alpha)_{\alpha \in J} \mapsto x_\beta
    \]
    for each $\beta \in J$.
    Then, $\pi_\beta$ is called the \textit{projection mapping}
    associated with the index $\beta$.
}

\dfn{Product Topology}{
    Let $\{X_{\alpha}\}_{\alpha \in J}$ be an indexed family of topological spaces.
    Let $\mcal S_\beta$ denote the collection
    \[
        \mcal S_\beta = \{\,\pi_\beta\inv(U_\beta) \mid U_\beta \text{ is open in } X_\beta\,\}
    \] and let
    \[
        \mcal S = \bigcup_{\alpha \in J} S_\alpha\text{.}
    \]
    The topology generated by the subbasis $\mcal S$ for $\prod_{\alpha \in J} X_\alpha$
    is called the \textit{product topology}.
    In this topology, $\prod_{\alpha \in J} X_\alpha$ is called a \textit{product space}.
